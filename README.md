# The-Relationship-Between-Health-Expenditure-and-GDP-per-Capita-at-Global-and-National-Income-Levels
This paper examined the impact of current healthcare expenditure from 2000 to 2019 on the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Both a global effect and an effect on country income were considered. Data from the World Development Indicators Database and the World Health Organizationâ€™s Global Health Expenditure Database were used. A panel regression comparing pooled OLS, random effects, and fixed effects were used to find the best fit for the model of interest. The overall result of this work is that current healthcare expenditure is negatively correlated with GDP per capita, as expected, but the sign of this correlation is not significant. The overall fit of our model of interest is a fixed effect model. This is true for both the global effect and the country income effect, except for some country income groups. However, the result of this paper has some limitations that should be considered in further research.
